/**
 * Keeps the local player gliding through a moment the server stops the glide, without Grim (2b2t) noticing: the
 * trick behind No Durability.
 * <p>
 * The server stops a glide (it sees the elytra come off, or you land) by sending your entity flags with the gliding bit
 * cleared. Grim sends one of its pings just before those flags, and only takes the glide as stopped once that ping is
 * answered. So from the ping that came in right before the clear, the answers are held back: Grim keeps expecting
 * gliding, and the client keeps gliding (the clear isn't applied). The owner then sends the answers ({@link #release()})
 * just before it starts gliding again, so Grim sees the stop and then the new start, in order, and nothing in between
 * looks wrong to it. One owner at a time; the hold is let go if the owner doesn't release it within a second.
 * <p>
 * The ping and flags are watched as they arrive, on the network thread (the ping is answered on the game thread
 * before the flags are applied); the mixins call in on the game thread to hold answers and keep the glide.
