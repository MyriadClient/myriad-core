/**
 * Which chunks Grim (2b2t) knows the client has. Grim sends one of its pings after each chunk and only counts the chunk
 * as loaded on the client once that ping is answered; standing in a chunk it doesn't count yet, you're set back. Pings
 * are normally answered at once, so this only matters while {@link GlideHolder} holds the answers back: a chunk that
 * arrives meanwhile stays unknown to Grim until they go out. Flying fast into chunks the server sends just in time (2b2t
 * in new terrain), a hold can run into one.
 * <p>
 * Pings are numbered as they arrive; each chunk keeps the number of the last ping before it, and is known once a later
 * ping has been answered. Chunks that came before {@link #start} are taken as known.
